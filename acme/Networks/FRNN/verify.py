    Function that verifies if the person on the "image_path" image is "identity".

    Arguments:
    image_path -- path to an image
    identity -- string, name of the person you'd like to verify the identity. Has to be a resident of the Happy house.
    database -- python dictionary mapping names of allowed people's names (strings) to their encodings (vectors).
    model -- your Inception model instance in Keras

    dist -- distance between the image_path and the image of "identity" in the database.
    door_open -- True, if the door should open. False otherwise.
